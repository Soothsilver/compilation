These tasks could be completed later on if we want to:

- If a local variable is used before it is initialized, report an error.
- If there exists an execution path in a function that is not ended by a return statement, report an error.
- If there exists an inaccessible statement, report it as an error.
- Accept "[2,4]" as an array constructor of an integer array of type 2
- Accept "[]" as the empty array of an inferred type and "new [3]" as an array of size 3 of an inferred type.
