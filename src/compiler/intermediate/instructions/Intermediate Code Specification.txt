Intermediate Code Instructions:
GETPARAM ( register , index ) : Copies the argument at index "index" to register "register".
x = y operator z
x = operator y
x = y
LABEL ( labelName )
JUMP ( labelName / register )
IF x JUMP ( labelName / register )
PARAM x
CALL register, subroutineName: Calls subroutineName and saves the result into register "register"
RETURN x
SYSCALL systemCallName

x,y,z are operands:
- immediate
- REG(index)
- MEM(index)
- MEM(REG(index))
